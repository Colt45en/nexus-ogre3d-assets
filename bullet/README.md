# Bullet Physics Headers Directory

This directory contains Bullet Physics header files for collision detection and physics simulation.

## Contents:
- Bullet Physics C++ header files (.h, .hpp)
- Configuration headers for physics integration
- Custom collision shape definitions
- Physics world setup files

## Integration:
These headers are used to:
- Define physics shapes for 3D models
- Set up collision detection systems
- Configure rigid body dynamics
- Handle physics material properties

## Usage:
Include these headers in your C++ OGRE application to enable:
- Collision detection between game objects
- Realistic physics simulation  
- Trigger volumes and sensors
- Particle physics systems
